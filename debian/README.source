Source tarball was repackaged from ARIA-2.7.5.2+gcc4.3.tgz since the upstream
tarball was not source only.

Repackaging was done as follows:

$ wget http://robots.mobilerobots.com/ARIA/download/current/ARIA-2.7.5.2+gcc4.3.tgz
$ tar xzf ARIA-2.7.5.2+gcc4.3.tgz
$ mv Aria-2.7.5.2 libaria-2.7.5.2.orig
$ cd libaria-2.7.5.2.orig
$ patch -p1 < /path/to/libaria_source/debian/patches/fix-upstream-makefile.patch
$ make fullCleanAll cleanDoc cleanParams
$ patch -p1 -R < /path/to/libaria_source/debian/patches/fix-upstream-makefile.patch
$ cd ..
$ tar cjf libaria_2.7.5.2.orig.tar.bz2 libaria-2.7.5.2.orig/

The get-orig-source target is provided in debian/rules, but assumes it's
invoked in debian directory.
