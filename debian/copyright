 Source tarball was repackaged from ARIA-2.7.5.2+gcc4.3.tgz since the upstream tarball wasn't source only.
 Repackaging was done as follows:
 $ wget http://robots.mobilerobots.com/ARIA/download/current/ARIA-2.7.5.2+gcc4.3.tgz
 $ tar xzf ARIA-2.7.5.2+gcc4.3.tgz
 $ mv Aria-2.7.5.2 libaria-2.7.5.2.orig
 $ cd libaria-2.7.5.2.orig
 $ patch -p1 < /path/to/libaria_source/debian/patches/fix-upstream-makefile.patch
 $ make fullCleanAll cleanDoc cleanParams
 $ patch -p1 -R < /path/to/libaria_source/debian/patches/fix-upstream-makefile.patch
 $ cd ..
 $ tar cjf libaria_2.7.5.2.orig.tar.bz2 libaria-2.7.5.2.orig/
